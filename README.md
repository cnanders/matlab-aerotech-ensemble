# matlab-aerotech-ensemble
MATLAB communication class for Aerotech Ensemble motion controller


## Installation:

Only Matlab base with the provided Matlab library package are sufficient. There is no need for any Matlab toolbox or Simulink.

After installing Matlab and the Aerotech Ensemble software, locate the folder of Matlab in the Ensemble installation folder. Usually its address can be as follows.
C:\Program Files (x86)\Aerotech\Ensemble\Matlab

The Matlab library package is stored in the folder of x64 (if your computer architecture is x64) inside the Matlab directory above. To make sure that you do not modify any files in this Matlab library, you can copy the entire x64 folder and paste it into another location. For example, it can be placed in C:\Users\cxrodev\Documents\MATLAB\Aerotech

Copy the folder of AeroBasic from 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Aerotech\Ensemble\Samples
into the same folder as with the new x64 folder mentioned above. After that, in your C:\Users\cxrodev\Documents\MATLAB\Aerotech directory there are two folders, x64 and AeroBasic.

After having the x64 and AeroBasic folders at a new location, you can use the Matlab library functions stored in these new folders without referring to the original ones.
